# CDN Gateway Docker Compose - Minimal Production Configuration
#
# Core services start automatically. Dynamic services (trafficserver, traffic-monitor)
# are managed by blockcastd's compose_manager based on mconfig from controller.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up -d                    # Start core services
#   docker compose --profile managed up -d  # Start all services (for testing)
#
# For traffic-router and multicast, see docker-compose.internal.yml
